I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at Zhejiang University. My research focuses on large-scale hypothesis testing, selective inference, and deep learning for modern data-intensive scientific problems.

I enjoy building reliable statistical tools that bridge rigorous theory and practical machine learning systems. If you are interested in related topics or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out via email—always happy to chat.

## Blog / Notes

I keep longer-form reflections on studying mathematics and statistics in a standalone blog section. You can read them here: [blog]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}).
